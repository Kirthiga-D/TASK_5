Traffic Accident Data Analysis
This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It visualizes accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the US Accidents dataset (March 2023). It contains information about traffic accidents, including location, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.


Data Loading and Preprocessing
The data is loaded, and initial preprocessing steps are performed, such as handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns. Categorical columns are filled with the mode of each column, and duplicate entries are checked.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
City with Most Number of Accidents
An analysis is conducted to find the cities with the highest number of accidents. A bar plot visualizes the top 10 cities with the most number of accidents.

City with Least Number of Accidents
An analysis is conducted to find the cities with the lowest number of accidents. A bar plot visualizes the bottom 10 cities with the least number of accidents.

State with Most and Least Number of Accidents
An analysis is conducted to find the states with the highest and lowest number of accidents. A bar plot visualizes the top 5 states with the most number of accidents.

Visualization of Accident Hotspots and Contributing Factors
Visualizations are created to identify accident hotspots and understand contributing factors such as weather conditions and time of day.

Conclusion
This analysis helps in understanding the patterns of traffic accidents, which can be useful for policymakers and city planners to improve road safety measures.
